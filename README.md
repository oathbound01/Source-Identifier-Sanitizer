# Source Identifier Sanitizer
Simple Firefox extension that removes the Source Identifier parameter from YouTube share links

You can also click on the extension icon to manually sanitize links from other websites.

These parameters are currently supported:

- `si`: YouTube Source Identifier
- `utm_source`
- `igsh`: Instagram Source Identifier
- `mbextid`: Facebook Reels

Feel free to open a new issue to suggest more sanitizable parameters.
